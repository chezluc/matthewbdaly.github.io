    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve made the tough decision to abandon Blogger and move my blog to Wordpress. For those of you that have joined me from my old blog at <a href="http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/">http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/</a> thank you very much for doing so!</p>

<p>The new blog will have a somewhat different emphasis than my old one. Rather than being a bit of a free-for-all covering Linux, programming, new websites and anything else that I think of, this blog is going to be much more focused, with web development as the main subject. That said, we&rsquo;ll have to see how things work out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering another move in a few months time, with my site at <a href="http://www.matthewdaly.co.uk/">http://www.matthewdaly.co.uk/</a> becoming the new location of the blog, but that would require paid hosting, so I&rsquo;m going to give Wordpress a good try first before I commit to using it.</p>
