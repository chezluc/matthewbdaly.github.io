            <title><![CDATA[My first jQuery plugin]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In my day job, I recently finished <a href="https://www.pagepooch.com/">PagePooch</a>, a tool for monitoring web pages for changes in content or prices. It’s a project that I’m immensely proud of, because it was my first big and largely solo project as a developer.</p>
<p>During the development of this, I initially created the user interface with jQuery Mobile, but later on added a desktop interface as well. During development of the desktop interface, I needed to recreate the functionality of the filter available for listviews in jQuery Mobile, and wound up creating a plugin for jQuery to do so.</p>
<p>I recently got permission to open-source this, as I figured the functionality was trivial enough that we couldn’t reasonably sell it, but by making it freely available, we’d maybe get some goodwill, and if we were really lucky, a few bugfixes and/or improvements.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/listfilter/">now available</a> via the jQuery plugin registry. Please let me know what you think, and feel free to fork it and hack on it as you see fit.</p>
