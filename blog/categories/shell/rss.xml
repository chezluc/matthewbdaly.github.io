            <description><![CDATA[<p>For a while now I’ve been looking for a good free shell account provider, and the other day I stumbled across the best I’ve ever seen at <a href="http://devio.us/">http://devio.us/</a>. They run OpenBSD, they provide pretty much everything you could want from a shell account provider, and they’ve been very willing to help so far - when I asked if they had plans to add Python support, they added it within 24 hours. If you’re looking for a good shell account provider, I suggest you give them a try.</p>
