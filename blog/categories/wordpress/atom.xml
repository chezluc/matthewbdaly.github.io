    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve gotten more and more fed up with WordPress as a blogging platform. It&rsquo;s certainly a great content management system, and for non-technical bloggers it&rsquo;s absolutely perfect, but I&rsquo;ve been increasingly finding myself hitting barriers that make it harder than it should be to get stuff done. It&rsquo;s just not the best platform for blogging about web development.</p>

<p>Take my recent series of Django tutorials, for example. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the amount of time I spent trying to format some of the code properly in TinyMCE for those. Furthermore, the end result, even though the theme was a custom one I&rsquo;d built myself that was somewhat optimised for showing off code, wasn&rsquo;t exactly great.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Markdown is a far better option for writing blog posts in than using a rich text editor like TinyMCE. You normally have a pretty good idea what the end results will look like, and it&rsquo;s generally well-formatted HTML. Also, it means I can easily write my blog posts in Vim.</p>

<p>Octopress was therefore an obvious choice. It&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant for sharing code - compared to WordPress, code samples look <em>stunning</em>. Also, because it generates static HTML, it loads an awful lot faster than WordPress does, and the default theme is extremely nice. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve gone for.</p>

<p>The only issue is that my web host are a bit funny about offering SSH access, so I&rsquo;ve resorted to FTP-ing the files across, which isn&rsquo;t ideal. Still, it&rsquo;s not that big an issue, and I&rsquo;ll have to see how it goes with Octopress. I do have a low-end VPS I could point this domain name at instead and run it from there if necessary, so I can always resort to that if this is too cumbersome.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a long time now, I&rsquo;ve kept meaning to write my own WordPress theme from scratch for this site, but just haven&rsquo;t been able to find the time to do so. Now, I&rsquo;ve finally found the time to do so, and here it is!</p>

<p>Please let me know what you think, but be gentle (this is my first solo WordPress theme, and also the only one I&rsquo;ve built completely from scratch), and if you find any issues with it please let me know. Don&rsquo;t expect it to look great in IE6 or IE7 however - I&rsquo;ve given it a very cursory review in those browsers, and that&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s still perfectly readable, but it uses a fair amount of CSS3 so it&rsquo;s inevitably not going to look as pretty in those browsers.</p>

<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/Steel-Age">on GitHub</a> if you want to take a look.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve now gone and switched to paid hosting, and have dumped the old static site in favour of a Wordpress-powered blog on my own domain. I&rsquo;ve found Wordpress to be an extremely flexible and powerful solution, far superior to Blogger, and I&rsquo;m really excited about the possibilities of a self-hosted blog, so I&rsquo;m really looking forward to establishing myself here! At some point I intend to create a custom theme of my own, but for now this one will do fine!</p>

<p>As I mentioned previously, I&rsquo;ve changed the emphasis of the blog towards web development. I&rsquo;ve also now made a number of other improvements - comments are now powered by Disqus, to facilitate easier sharing of posts and making it easier for people to reply to me via blog posts of their own.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
