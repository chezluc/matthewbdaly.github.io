I blog regularly about web development, particularly about Django and Node.js, and have also [written for Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/mdaly/). Outside of work and extra-curricular coding I'm a huge fan of *Firefly* and *Archer*, and have spent *way* too much time lately playing *Skyrim* and the *Mass Effect* series. I've also begun developing an appreciation of Guinness.
