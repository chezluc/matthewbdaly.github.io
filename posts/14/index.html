It’s quite an interesting topic since unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a proper programming language (OK, technically it’s a scripting language, but it’s not merely a markup language like HTML), so I’m quite enjoying it.</p><p>However, I’m a little disappointed with the quality of the training materials for the course (CIW JavaScript Fundamentals). It was published in 2003, and recommends the use of Windows ME or Windows 2000, and Internet Explorer 5.5 or later, or Netscape Navigator 4.0 or later. Now, IE5.5 was released in July 2000, making it a few months shy of a decade old, a staggering length of time for the web. Netscape Navigator is even older, dating back to June 1997! Of those two browsers, IE5.5 now has a miniscule market share, and Netscape Navigator isn’t actively developed at all anymore (although Mozilla Firefox is built off the same code base).</p><p>Given that in the last few years Internet Explorer has been rapidly losing market share, and developers are doing things with JavaScript that we couldn’t dream of five years ago, you’d hope the course would cover the more interesting and powerful things we can do with JavaScript today, such as AJAX, Greasemonkey scripts or third-party libraries such as jQuery. Instead, I’m stuck with form validation (OK, fair enough, need to learn that), manipulating frames (seriously, frames? When was the last time you even saw a framed website? They’re ugly and a pain to use) and pop-up windows.</p><p>Personally I’m more than willing to take up the slack myself by studying independently, but I’m sure there are plenty of people who wouldn’t do so until they reach the workplace. Admittedly, the fundamentals of the language haven’t changed, but there’s plenty of stuff that’s of very little use today that I’ve had to learn when I could be learning something more useful.</p><p>So surely these texts are long overdue for a refresh? I would hope that a newer release would cover at least some of the following:</p><ul><li><p>At least one third-party JavaScript library, such as script.aculo.us or jQuery.</p></li><li><p>Writing Greasemonkey scripts (which is a very good way of learning more about JavaScript).</p></li><li><p>Creating a simple AJAX application.</p></li><li><p>Using a JavaScript debugger such as Firebug.</p></li></ul><p>I really don’t think there’s any excuse for the training materials being that outdated when some of their other CIW training materials are much more current.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">3rd May 2010 12:04 am</p><h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/03/devio-us/">Devio.us</a></h1><p>For a while now I’ve been looking for a good free shell account provider, and the other day I stumbled across the best I’ve ever seen at <a href="http://devio.us/">http://devio.us/</a>. They run OpenBSD, they provide pretty much everything you could want from a shell account provider, and they’ve been very willing to help so far - when I asked if they had plans to add Python support, they added it within 24 hours. If you’re looking for a good shell account provider, I suggest you give them a try.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">2nd May 2010 11:57 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/02/my-new-home-on-the-web/">My New Home on the Web</a></h1><p>I’ve made the tough decision to abandon Blogger and move my blog to Wordpress. For those of you that have joined me from my old blog at <a href="http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/">http://farbeyondtheedgeofreason.blogspot.com/</a> thank you very much for doing so!</p><p>The new blog will have a somewhat different emphasis than my old one. Rather than being a bit of a free-for-all covering Linux, programming, new websites and anything else that I think of, this blog is going to be much more focused, with web development as the main subject. That said, we’ll have to see how things work out.</p><p>I’m considering another move in a few months time, with my site at <a href="http://matthewdaly.co.uk/">http://matthewdaly.co.uk/</a> becoming the new location of the blog, but that would require paid hosting, so I’m going to give Wordpress a good try first before I commit to using it.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">21st April 2010 3:06 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2010/04/21/passed/">Passed!</a></h1><p>Today I took the exam for my CIW Database Design Specialist course, and I’m pleased to say that I passed with flying colours! I find it hard to believe that I’ve managed to actually accumulate that much information about relational databases, but somehow I did it!</p><p>Now to actually get out of my existing customer services role and into the IT industry! I’m still studying as I’ve got a lot more work to do for the rest of my CIW Master Enterprise Developer certification, but this means I’ve got a lot more options open to me - database administration’s a possibility but really I’m more interested in web development. I’ve got to study JavaScript next, then Perl, then PHP and classic ASP before moving on to Java.</p></article><article class="post"><p class="date">18th April 2010 8:09 pm</p><h1><a href="/blog/2010/04/18/election-time/">Election Time</a></h1><p>As you may be aware, election time is looming in the UK. As someone who considers themselves old-school Labour (as opposed to Tony Blair’s New Labour) there isn’t really a party I feel I can align myself with anymore, so I tend to vote more based on issues than habit. I have, however, always felt that if you don’t vote you can’t complain about the government so I make a point of always doing so.</p><p>Like many others, I was appalled by the way the Digital Economy Act was pushed through by a Parliament that clearly didn’t understand its full implications. Its primary architect, Peter Mandelson, clearly didn’t understand a thing about how the digital economy works. This piece of legislation is ill-conceived at best and downright scandalous at worst.</p><p>So I’m very pleased to learn that <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/041710-clegg-reaffirms-lib-dem-opposition.html">the Liberal Democrats are calling for it to be repealed</a>. I’m even more pleased to learn that <a href="http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/liberal-democrats-surge-in-uk-election-20100419-smuw.html">the Lib Dems have experienced a significant surge in support</a>. Realistically I don’t think they are likely to win the election, but there is a fair chance that they may gain sufficient votes to force the majority party to enter into a coalition with them, meaning they may well get the opportunity to repeal the Digital Economy Act. Plus, there’s the possibility of the extremely capable Vince Cable (who unlike many other politicians actually realised that people taking on unprecedented levels of personal debt was a bad idea) being Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><p>I have a strong dislike of Tories in general, and David Cameron doesn’t actually appear to stand for anything much - he’s one of the most superficial politicians in government at the moment. I still remember the shambles of the last Tory government and there’s no way I’d want to repeat that.</p><p>While I would love the Pirate Party to be standing for election in South Norfolk, sadly they aren’t. While the Green Party have also said they are opposed to the DEA, they remain a fringe party. I feel that the Labour Party have had their own way for too long and it would be good to either get rid of them or make them share power so they don’t have the opportunity to force objectionable legislation through.</p><p>I’m therefore throwing my support behind the Liberal Democrats. I intend to vote for them, and if you’re concerned about the consequences of the Digital Economy Act too, I recommend you vote for them as well. They’re the only major party who actually seem to understand the issues at hand. Hamstringing the digital economy to benefit the analogue one is not the way to guarantee this country’s future, and only the Lib Dems seem to have grasped this.</p></article></div><div class="col-md-4"><h1>Recent Posts</h1><p><a href="/blog/2015/06/14/setting-etags-in-laravel-5/">Setting Etags in Laravel 5</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/05/03/my-static-site-generator-post-on-sitepoint/">My Static Site Generator Post on Sitepoint</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/04/18/how-i-added-search-to-my-site-with-lunr-dot-js/">How I Added Search to My Site With Lunr.js</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/04/04/adding-a-new-search-engine-to-my-site/">Adding a New Search Engine to My Site</a></p><p><a href="/blog/2015/03/02/syntax-highlighting-in-fenced-code-blocks-in-vim/">Syntax Highlighting in Fenced Code Blocks in Vim</a></p><section id="github-profile"></section><h4>My GitHub repositories</h4><ul id="github-repos"><li>Loading repositories...</li></ul></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><ul class="pager"><li><a href="/posts/13/">Newer</a></li><li><a href="/posts/15/">Older</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container footercontainer"><div class="col-md-12"><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; Matthew Daly 2015.</p></div></div></footer><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/all.min.js"></script><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
