  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my initial struggles with Perl, I now think I&rsquo;m really starting to get to grips with the language. I generally find it a pain when you have to learn by building small but basically useless scripts - I always do best when building something useful.</p>

<p>As one of the exercises for my studies I had to open a database connection to a Microsoft Access database, but I wanted to do the exercise in Ubuntu (I&rsquo;ve always preferred using Unix-like operating systems for programming, and thanks to apt-get it&rsquo;s a lot less grief installing additional libraries and modules as you need them) and couldn&rsquo;t get Perl to connect to the database properly, so I resolved to export it to either MySQL or SQLite.</p>

<p>I was able to export it to MySQL in the end using mdbtools, but I wasn&rsquo;t entirely happy with the end result. I resorted to re-exporting the data as a CSV file, then resolved to write a small Perl script to read the file, parse it using a regular expression to obtain the necessary information, then insert it into a new SQLite database.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I came up with:</p>

<p>Apologies for the fact that the indentation doesn&rsquo;t seem to have copied across from Vim very well (can anyone recommend a good WordPress plugin for displaying code, none of the ones I&rsquo;ve tried seem to be any good?). It works well, and it&rsquo;s also helped me grasp Perl&rsquo;s database API better.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got a better idea now of what Python and Perl are best at and when to use each. Perl is a great language, but the fact that a lot of it is implicit makes it a little harder to pick up at first than Python - for instance, the default variable, which is quite a good idea, but takes a little getting used to. Its regex support is great, and I like the database API, but I would find it a lot harder to do any object-oriented programming in Perl than in Python (which I guess is why <a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/">Moose</a> exists). I&rsquo;ve found Perl very useful for quick and dirty scripts and as a glue language, but for longer scripts Python seems the better choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I own a lot of programming textbooks. I went through a long phase of buying ones about virtually any technology I was even remotely interested in, therefore I own loads of books about Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP and C, among others. Granted, with many of them I&rsquo;ve done little more than flick through them (I find it&rsquo;s hard to get round to learning things like that without some kind of plan, which was what made me eventually start doing a more formal course since it forced a plan on me), but I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few.</p>

<p>But of course, not every textbook is equal. Some are great, truly seminal works that are raved about by well-known programmers. Examples include the Camel book (Programming Perl) and K &amp; R (The C Programming Language). Others are rarely mentioned. But what makes a really good textbook? Here I&rsquo;m going to list some of the attributes that I&rsquo;ve found in my favourite and most effective programming texts, and that I think make for a good, effective and informative textbook that makes a good job of getting you up and running programming in a new language:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lots of working examples to enter</strong> - To learn to program, whether from scratch or in a brand new language, the best advice I&rsquo;ve ever heard was that you need to read a lot of code, and write a lot of code. I find that, at least at the start, nothing helps me learn to code in a new language better than lots of examples for me to type in and run, in order to pick up the basic syntax and keywords of the language. After all, that&rsquo;s how many people used to learn BASIC, by typing in listings from magazines, and it&rsquo;s how you learn English as a child - you&rsquo;re exposed to the language, and you copy it, then understanding comes later. One of the best examples of this is C for Dummies, All In One Desktop Reference, by Dan Godkin - it&rsquo;s packed full of loads of great example programs to enter and run that demonstrate the basic concepts well in C.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintains your interest by showing you how to do interesting things</strong> - Not many people are interested in learning a new programming language to do something tedious (that said, if someone already has to do something tedious, such as a task at work, teaching them how to write a program to do it for them may well be considerably more interesting for them than doing the task themselves, hence the popularity of scripting languages for automating dull tasks), so a good programming textbook needs to show the learner how to do something interesting. Games are an obvious example, but they can get a bit much - how many different versions of Hangman do people want to create? Simple web apps are also an option with many programming languages. If something needs to be more utilitarian, then if possible it should be genuinely useful for solving a problem (the programmer doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to have this problem, they just need to see how to create a program to fix it). Frivolous little scripts that do things like recite &ldquo;99 Bottles of Beer&rdquo; to demonstrate for loops have their place, but that place is near the start only - by the end a programmer wants to be able to write useful programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Good exercises to stretch the reader </strong>- Many textbooks will have additional exercises for the reader at the end of each chapter that allow them to practice their skills and ensure they aren&rsquo;t just copying a listing, but are genuinely capable of writing code from scratch in the language. These are effectively the &ldquo;homework&rdquo; assignments, and I&rsquo;ve found that these can be far more important at teaching me how to use the language well for actual programming projects than the listings within the book.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are my thoughts, but I&rsquo;d be interested to read what other people think about this issue. What&rsquo;s the best programming textbook you&rsquo;ve ever used, and why do you like it? What do you think a good programming textbook should have?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m currently studying for the CIW Web Developer qualification, and having passed the exams for database design and JavaScript, I&rsquo;m now on to the third component, Perl. I figured that having already picked up a reasonable grasp of another scripting language (namely Python), that I would have no trouble picking up Perl quickly, as happened when I learned JavaScript.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out as well as I&rsquo;d hoped so far, and in a number of ways. First of all, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to &ldquo;fit your brain&rdquo; quite as easily as Python does - I find that the significant number of non-alphanumeric characters used makes it less intuitive than Python, at least for me. I&rsquo;m also not a great fan of the syntax - in particular, I really am not keen on the syntax used for object-oriented programming. In general I&rsquo;m finding it a struggle to pick up many things I learned quite quickly in Python.</p>

<p>That said, Perl has plenty of awesome features. CPAN has a staggering number of modules available, and makes it very easy to install them. And of course, its support for regular expressions is second to none. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a language I really want to know better and be able to use well, but I am finding it quite hard going compared to Python.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect, however, that it may well be, at least in part, because I learned Python first and my brain is used to the Pythonic way of doing things, therefore I&rsquo;m having to unlearn those habits for Perl. Has anyone else learned Python first and then struggled to pick up Perl, or is it just me? Does learning Python first predispose you to finding Perl more difficult?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought my MacBook two years ago, and at first I was cynical about how I would find it compared to Ubuntu, but over time I found myself using it more and more. While I have never considered myself a Mac user (I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as a Linux user who owns a Mac), I did grow to appreciate the combination of a solid Unix base with a well thought-out GUI, and it worked out well for me.</p>

<p>Yet now I&rsquo;m finding myself slowly moving back to Linux. I&rsquo;m running Slackware 13.1 on an old Inspiron I&rsquo;ve had since 2004, and my recently purchased Dell Studio 15 dual-boots Windows 7 and Ubuntu. But the one I&rsquo;m using by far the most is my Mini Inspiron, which dual-boots Windows XP and Ubuntu Netbook Edition, and XP almost never gets used.</p>

<p>Part of the reason is that the Mini itself is just such a handy machine to have around - it&rsquo;s small enough to be portable, and it&rsquo;s convenient to use it anywhere at home too, but at the same time it&rsquo;s big enough to use without any issues (which is more than I can say about my old Eee PC, which has now been passed on to my sister). OK, not everyone likes Dell&rsquo;s products, but I&rsquo;ve always found them to be very good value basic computers, and they really have gotten the whole netbook idea and produced an excellent product.</p>

<p>Also, Ubuntu Netbook Edition is really great - the newly revamped user interface works really well on the netbook form factor, and it&rsquo;s an excellent experience for the most part. Performance is more than acceptable, and most applications start very quickly (Chrome is noticeably faster than on OS X).</p>

<p>But the thing that I&rsquo;m really starting to appreciate more than anything else is just how much more powerful and flexible it is under the bonnet than OS X. For starters, a package manager like apt-get makes it incredibly easy to install new software. In particular, this is useful for installing useful Python modules, as so far as I&rsquo;m aware Python doesn&rsquo;t have anything like Perl&rsquo;s CPAN or Ruby&rsquo;s rubygem system. Yes, I guess I could use MacPorts or something like that, but personally I&rsquo;ve never liked the idea of installing a new package manager yourself rather than using one that&rsquo;s a fundamental part of the OS.</p>

<p>This also means I have to compile many Python modules from source on OS X. This has taught me an interesting lesson about usability - namely that it&rsquo;s not an absolute. For many tasks Ubuntu is actually considerably easier to use than OS X, since Synaptic offers users the opportunity to install a lot of software from a GUI that on OS X would need to be compiled from source, although for installation of desktop applications OS X is probably marginally easier.</p>

<p>Also, byobu is an excellent tool - it really helps to make GNU screen more useful and accessible. I have it set up to launch screen in any new terminal sessions and I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder how I ever coped without it.</p>

<p>Finally, Snow Leopard seems to have broken a lot of things I liked in OS X. I used to use the Terminator terminal emulator in Leopard and it worked well, but in Snow Leopard, Spotlight can&rsquo;t find it (I think it&rsquo;s something to do with the Java bridge being deprecated, as Terminator is written in Java), so I had to change to iTerm instead, which I don&rsquo;t like so much. Snow Leopard also seems to refuse to open browser bookmarks via Spotlight in anything but Safari, which really gets on my nerves as I hate Safari.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not planning to get rid of my MacBook anytime soon, but I am increasingly finding it&rsquo;s less appropriate to my needs, less productive, and less powerful compared to Ubuntu.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unless you live in the southern hemisphere, summer&rsquo;s here. Right now it&rsquo;s gone midnight but it&rsquo;s still very hot, and being in the UK, where home air conditioning is not common, there&rsquo;s little way to alleviate the heat besides opening the window (which you don&rsquo;t want to do because people are continually having barbecues).</p>

<p>I have to admit to just not being a summer person - I don&rsquo;t really like hot weather or outdoor pursuits in general. I&rsquo;m happier in spring and autumn when it&rsquo;s cool, but not cold, and I can wear my favourite Animal hoodie if it does turn chillier. When it gets hot I find it extremely difficult to get anything done unless I can do so in a fully air-conditioned environment, and have a lot of trouble sleeping at night, exacerbating the problem due to tiredness. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m now having to learn Perl from scratch during this time (a fairly daunting prospect at the best of times!), and it&rsquo;s a bit of a nightmare trying to actually sit down and learn regular expressions properly when it&rsquo;s hot and stuffy and you can&rsquo;t think straight.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to try going to a nice cool air-conditioned cafe with my Dell Mini, get a cold drink and see if I can get some work done that way. But I&rsquo;m curious to know if anyone else has any good tips for remaining productive at learning a new programming language during hot weather that they&rsquo;d like to pass on?</p>

<time class='entry-date' datetime='2010-07-05T20:01:52+01:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Jul</span> <span class='date-day'>5</span><span class='date-suffix'>th</span>, <span class='date-year'>2010</span></span> <span class='time'>8:01 pm</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;re creating your first website, it&rsquo;s tempting to think that once you&rsquo;ve got the site looking the way you want it, and added some content, then that&rsquo;s all you need to do. In reality, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely that this is the case. It&rsquo;s fairly obvious with something like a blog that it needs regular care and attention, but even a static brochure site may need some additional resources to get the best out of it. Nowadays, there are loads of great resources around that you can use to enhance your websites, either for yourself or your readers (or both!) and knowing how to make the most of them can really make a difference in how well your site fulfills its intended role.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s a list of five things you should consider including when you set up your first website that are easy to overlook, but can offer real benefits to both you and your users. Note that there&rsquo;s more than a few Google tools here - this isn&rsquo;t deliberate, it&rsquo;s just that Google are so omnipresent in this area that it&rsquo;s hard to get away from them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>A way to record visitor&rsquo;s details</strong> - With most web hosts you can just look at the log files, but that doesn&rsquo;t provide very much information at all, nor does it present it in a way that makes it easy to see the information you need. A much better idea is to use a dedicated web analytics service. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> in the past, but my favourite has to be <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. Both give you access to a great deal of useful information about your website. For instance, you can see how many people view the site in Internet Explorer 6, so you can figure out for yourself whether it&rsquo;s worth bothering to adjust for IE6 when you redesign the site next. Or you could see how many people view the site in a mobile browser. You can also see what pages are popular, how long people remain on your site, and how they got there in the first place. All this is extremely useful information that can give you good ideas as to how to improve your site.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>A comment system </strong>- OK, this is blog-specific, but comments mean you can gauge reader interest levels, and encourage more reader participation, so having a good comment system is essential. Most blogging engines have an OK comment system, but there are a few dedicated comment systems you can install on your blog that offer a lot more features than the default system. For instance, my blog uses <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> in preference to the default WordPress comment system, because I find it&rsquo;s far more flexible and powerful. It offers threaded comments, as well as support for readers logging in via Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo!, OpenID or Disqus, which means they can use an existing account to submit their comment rather than having to go through the rigmarole of signing up, which can dissuade people from commenting. Also, it offers fine-grained control of moderation and spam, such as allowing you to blacklist or whitelist commenters, automatically accept comments unless they include a link (very handy for tackling spam comments), and many other useful tools. I&rsquo;ve also heard good things about <a href="http://intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a>.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>RSS feed management</strong> - If your site has an RSS feed, you should seriously consider using <a href="http://feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a>. It&rsquo;s a great tool that allows you to present your site&rsquo;s RSS feed in an extremely pleasant way that makes it extremely easy for readers to subscribe using whatever feed reader they like, or by email (always worth having because it&rsquo;s ideal for people who don&rsquo;t know what an RSS feed is). It also allows you to add easy ways for users to share your content from within the feed, or for you to add Google AdSense to the feed itself if you wish.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>A way to share content</strong> - Again, this is more blog-specific than something suitable for a static site, but you should make it easy for people to share posts they like with friends or submit them to social bookmarking sites. It&rsquo;s probably to your benefit to do so since this will not only send more traffic to your site, but will mean you gain additional links to your site, improving its ranking in Google searches. Some WordPress themes include a way to share content, but other themes, or different blogging engines, may not offer this so an alternative way to share is helpful. In particular, I can recommend <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a> as a good choice.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>AdWords </strong>- If your site is something you&rsquo;re hoping to make money from (such as an e-commerce site, or you&rsquo;re hoping to attract people there to hire your services), then it makes sense to advertise. While I don&rsquo;t wish to sound like one of those self-appointed &ldquo;social media experts&rdquo; who haunt Twitter, you do need to make an effort to get your name out there, and <a href="http://adwords.google.com">Google AdWords</a> is a really great way to do that cheaply and easily. You only need to pay when someone clicks on an ad, and they only show up in relevant places.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>What other services would you recommend using with a new website?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m glad to report that today I passed my CIW JavaScript Fundamentals exam with 98%! I was a bit concerned about this as some of the questions on the practice exam were downright wrong (as in the supposedly correct answers were in fact wrong), but thankfully this turned out not to be the case for the actual exam.</p>

<p>Next step is learning Perl. I&rsquo;m particularly interested to learn more about Perl because it&rsquo;s something you can get a lot of use out of - it can be used for regular expressions, general Unix scripting and web development, and I&rsquo;m interested to see how it compares to Python.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a short note to say that tomorrow morning I have my CIW JavaScript Fundamentals exam. Hopefully I should be able to pass first time (although I&rsquo;m not impressed by how inaccurate the practice exams are, and how out of date the training materials are), and should then be able to get on with learning Perl next. I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning Perl, as it&rsquo;s more the kind of thing I&rsquo;m interested in than JavaScript is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I set up this blog, I was torn over the decision whether to include adverts or not. On the one hand, the hosting costs, while not unreasonable, are still fairly substantial at around £10 a month, and any help in paying that would be very welcome. On the other hand, I was very concerned that adverts would drive away potential readers, and make me seem like one of the self-appointed &ldquo;social media experts&rdquo; that haunt Twitter, which isn&rsquo;t my intention at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an Adblock and Flashblock user myself, so I would never, ever consider the kind of nasty, intrusive adverts you see on many sites, either videos, images or Flash animations. The one kind of advert I don&rsquo;t have a problem with is simple text ads, like you see on Google search results, and at a stretch, simple image-based ones. As long as adverts are simple, unobtrusive, relevant and don&rsquo;t affect the visitor&rsquo;s experience, then I don&rsquo;t have too much of a problem with them in theory. The trouble is, few are.</p>

<p>Now, I had no realistic expectations that I would get rich from this blog, nor was I expecting that I would be likely to earn any money at all from it. I was simply hoping to offset some of the costs of hosting. I paid for web hosting because I was fed up with the limits of hosted blogging, and wanted to have the flexibility of blogging on my own domain, and I accepted the costs of hosting as necessary for that. I decided in the end that adverts were likely to be detrimental to this site&rsquo;s health, would be disliked and wouldn&rsquo;t earn much money, so I chose not to add them. I might consider using an affiliate program (such as linking to books or albums I like and would recommend), but otherwise my site is an advertisement-free zone, and for the foreseeable future I intend it to remain so.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your opinion on advertisements on websites? What criteria do you apply when deciding whether to include advertisements or not, and what advertisements to include?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t know how or when it happened, but suddenly I&rsquo;ve noticed that a hell of a lot of people I wouldn&rsquo;t normally expect to pay much attention when someone nags them to update their web browser are using Google Chrome. Non computer-savvy work colleagues are using it, and even my father has dumped Internet Explorer 8 in favour of Chrome - yet he wouldn&rsquo;t consider Firefox despite my years of virtually begging him to switch!</p>

<p>In May 2010, the statistics on W3Schools.com are quite telling. Google Chrome makes up 14.5% of the hits on the site, which is higher than either IE6 or IE7 - IE8 is the only version of Internet Explorer that&rsquo;s still ahead. Chrome is still behind Firefox, which takes up a huge 46.9% of the hits, but it&rsquo;s not bad for a browser that&rsquo;s been out for less than two years. More notably, Chrome has increased its market share by around 5% in the last six months, while IE6 has declined by a little over 3%. Granted, W3Schools is likely to be frequented mostly by web professionals who use more modern browsers, but in terms of the decline of IE6 at least, they&rsquo;re backed up by Statcounter, who have reported that <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/01/ie6-below-5-percent/">IE6 usage has fallen below 5%</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>This can&rsquo;t be a bad thing - Chrome&rsquo;s one of the fastest and most standards-compliant browsers around and has some of the best support for HTML5 and CSS3, as well as fast and efficient execution of JavaScript. It also has one of the best security records of any modern web browser - it&rsquo;s consistently been the only desktop web browser to survive the Pwn2Own contest unscathed.</p>

<p>But why is this happening? Accepted wisdom for some time has been that non-technical users just use whatever browser comes with their computer, thus giving IE a huge advantage, but the increasing popularity of Chrome runs counter to this, so it&rsquo;s clearly more complex than that. So much of its growth has been very recent that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s likely to be technically adept users, many of whom are already attached to Firefox or Safari (I still use Firefox sometimes myself, although for most things I&rsquo;ve switched to Chrome).</p>

<p>I think part of the reason is the fact that Google are dropping IE6 support on their sites, particularly YouTube, which is a hugely popular site, thus forcing people to ditch IE6 for something else. Naturally, Google provide links to download Chrome on the site, so maybe people are just going for the first alternative they see that will work.</p>

<p>Have you noticed this? Why do you think some non-technical users are switching to Chrome when they wouldn&rsquo;t switch to Firefox?</p>
