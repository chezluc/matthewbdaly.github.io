            <description><![CDATA[<p>I ran into a small issue today. I’m working on a Django app which uses Celery to handle certain tasks that don’t need to return a response within the context of the HTTP request. I also wanted to use <code>django_behave</code> for running BDD tests. The trouble is that both <code>django_behave</code> and Celery provide their own custom test runners that extend the default Django test runner, and so it looked like I might have to choose between the two.</p>
<p>However, it turned out that the Celery one was actually very simple, with only a handful of changes needing to be made to the default...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Although I’d prefer to use Python or Node.js, there are some times when circumstances dictate that I need to use PHP for a project at work. In the past, I used CodeIgniter, but that was through nothing more than inertia. For some time I’d been planning to switch to Laravel, largely because of the baked-in PHPUnit support, but events conspired against me - one big project that came along had a lot in common with an earlier one, so I forked it rather than starting over.</p>
<p>Recently I built a REST API for a mobile app, and I decided to use that to try out Laravel (if it had been available ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned a while back, I recently switched the search on my site from Google’s site-specific search to <a href="http://lunrjs.com/">Lunr.js</a>. Since my site is built with a static site generator, I can’t implement search using database queries, and I was keen to have an integrated search method that would be fast and not require server-side scripting, and Lunr.js seemed to fit the bill.</p>
<p>The first task in implementing it was to generate the index. As I wrote the Grunt task that generates the blog, I amended that task to generate an index at the same time as I generated the pos...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve just finished implementing a new search engine for this site. Obviously, with it using a static site generator, searching a relational database isn’t an option. For a long while I’d just been getting by with Google’s site-specific search, which worked, but meant leaving the site to view the search results.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve implemented a client-side search system using <a href="http://lunrjs.com/">Lunr.js</a>. It wasn’t too time consuming, and as the index is generated with the rest of the site and loaded with the page, the response is almost instantaneous. I may write a future blog pos...]]></description>

<p>If you put the following code in your <code>.vimrc</code>, you can get syntax highlighting in those code blocks when you open up a Markdown file in Vim:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>As you may have seen if you’re visiting the site, I’ve finally switched over from Octopress to the static site generator I’ve been working on for the last few months. Apologies if you’re seeing lots of old posts in your RSS reader - there must have been an inconsistency between the RSS feed for this and that for Octopress.</p>
<p>I actually still really like Octopress, however I’m not and have never been a big fan of Ruby. Python and JavaScript are my two main go-to languages (although I do a lot of work professionally with PHP as well), so I wanted a solution in one of those languages, but...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting capabilities Redis offers is its support for Pub/Sub. This allows you to subscribe to a specific channel, and then react when some content is published to that channel. In this tutorial, we’ll build a very simple web-based chat system that demonstrates Redis’s Pub/Sub support in action. Chat systems are pretty much synonymous with Node.js - it’s widely considered the “Hello, World!” of Node.js. Since we already used Node with the prior Redis tutorial, then it also makes sense to stick with it for this project too.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The NoSQL movement is an exciting one for web developers. While relational databases such as MySQL are applicable to solving a wide range of problems, they aren’t the best solution for every problem. Sometimes you may find yourself dealing with a problem where an alternative data store may make more sense.</p>
<p>Redis is one of the data stores that have appeared as part of this movement, and is arguably one of the more generally useful ones. Since it solves different problems to a relational database, it’s not generally useful as an alternative to them - instead it is often used alongside ...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m a big fan of static site generators. I ditched WordPress for Octopress over two years ago because it was free to host on GitHub Pages and much faster, had much better syntax highlighting, and I liked being able to write posts in Vim, and I’ve never looked back since.</p>
<p>That said, Octopress is written in Ruby, a language I’ve never been that keen on. Ideally I’d prefer to use Python or JavaScript, but none of the solutions I’ve found have been to my liking. Recently I’ve been using Grunt and Yeoman to some extent, and I’ve wondered about the idea of creating a Yeoman generator to bu...]]></description>

<p>The biggest change is that Django 1.7 introduces its own migration system, which means South is now surplus to requirements. We therefore need to switch from South to Django’s native migrations. Fortunately, this is fairly straightforward.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had the occasion to reformat a load of dates in Vim from <code>DD/MM/YYYY</code> to <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>. In Vim, this is quite simple:</p>
